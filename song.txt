[verse 1]
I heard you like confidence
Well, I've got a lot of it
So baby, use common sense
Just don't be anonymous
I heard that you've been busy, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Trying my best not to step up on your landmine
But let's have some fun with it
'Cause you know I'm runnin' it

[Verse 2: Mikha & Gwen]
Got me goin' crazy, baby, no, don't be lazy
Come over and chase me, yeah, you better amaze me
I'm at the spot
Baby, tell me, are you ready or not?
Don't you leave me waitin'
