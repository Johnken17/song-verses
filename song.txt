[verse 1]
I heard you like confidence
Well, I've got a lot of it
So baby, use common sense
Just don't be anonymous
I heard that you've been busy, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine
Trying my best not to step up on your landmine
But let's have some fun with it
'Cause you know I'm runnin' it

[Verse 2: Mikha & Gwen]
Got me goin' crazy, baby, no, don't be lazy
Come over and chase me, yeah, you better amaze me
I'm at the spot
Baby, tell me, are you ready or not?
Don't you leave me waitin'

[Verse 3: Aiah & Jhoanna]
If you, you really like me
Baby, then just blink twice
If you, you really like me
Then you gotta roll the dice

[Chorus: Stacey & Gwen]
If you like me, blink twice
Are you naughty or nice?
Maybe add a little spice
If you're tryna roll the dice
Let me give you some advice
If you like me, blink twice, oh, oh
